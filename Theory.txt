The line **if __name__ == '__main__'** checks whether the Python file is being run as the main program or being imported as a module in another script. 
When a Python file is imported as a module, you typically don't want 
the scriptâ€™s top-level code (like test cases, command-line interfaces, or main functions) 
to execute. By wrapping the execution code inside 
if __name__ == '__main__':, 
you ensure that it only runs when the script is executed directly, not when imported.


A Python list(array) is a built-in data structure in Python that can store elements 
of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, objects).
NumPy arrays are designed for numerical operations and can perform complex mathematical computations efficiently.
Task is to print a reversed NumPy array with the element type float.
```
import numpy
def arrays(arr):
    a = numpy.array(arr, float)[::-1]
    return a

str = '1 2 3 4 -8 -10'
arr = str.strip().split(' ')
result = arrays(arr)
print(result)
```
